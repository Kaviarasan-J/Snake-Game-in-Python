## ‚ö° How It Works

- The game is built using **Tkinter** for the GUI.  
- **Snake** and **Food** are separate classes:  
  - `Snake` handles the snake‚Äôs body, movement, and growth.  
  - `Food` spawns randomly on the grid.  
- The game updates every few milliseconds using `window.after()`.  
- Collision detection checks for:  
  - Snake hitting the wall.  
  - Snake colliding with itself.  
- The score increases as the snake eats the food.
